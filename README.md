### :frowning_man: Little bio !
I'm :fr: guy who is passionate about IT, and more specifically about cybersecurity. I love Offensive and Defensive aspect of Cybersecurity, i also like GRC.

You'll find various tools I've created here, along with the integration and write-ups of the TryHackMe/HackTheBox machines I've rooted. This GitHub does not contain any scripts or other materials made as part of my work, only content created in my free time.

I hope you'll find what you're looking for!

🏴‍☠️ <b>HackTheBox Badge</b>:

<i>I do far more rooms on TryHackMe than on HackTheBox. 

Why :question:

Because the machines on TryHackMe are personal, whereas on HackTheBox, they're shared... </i>
