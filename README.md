### :frowning_man: Little bio !
I'm :fr: guy who is passionate about IT, and more specifically about cybersecurity. 

You'll find here various tools I've created, write up of the various TryHackMe/HackTheBox machines I've rooted.

I hope you'll find what you're looking for!

🏴‍☠️ <b>HackTheBox Badge</b>:

<i>I do far more rooms on TryHackMe than on HackTheBox. 

Why :question:

Because the machines on TryHackMe are personal, whereas on HackTheBox, they're shared... </i>
