### :frowning_man: Little bio !
I'm :fr: guy who is passionate about IT, and more specifically about cybersecurity. 

You'll find here various tools I've created, write up of the various TryHackMe/HackTheBox machines I've rooted.

I hope you'll find what you're looking for! 

:pirate_flag: <b>TryHackMe Badge</b>:

<img src="https://tryhackme-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/Frygg.png" alt="TryHackMe">

<i>I do far more rooms on TryHackMe than on HackTheBox. 

Why ? Because the machines on TryHackMe are personal, whereas on HackTheBox, they're shared... </i>
